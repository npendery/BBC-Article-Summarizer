FCC votes to overturn net neutrality rules - BBC News
Many fear that once the equal access rules go, ISPs will start blocking and throttling some data while letting other packets travel on "fast lanes" because firms have paid more to reach customers quicker.
Facebook, and Google's parent company Alphabet as well as many other net firms have backed the open net rules saying equal access was important for all.
Commissioners at the agency voted two-to-one to end a "net neutrality" order enacted in 2015.
